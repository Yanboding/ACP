&nbsp;
##### **Product Name:** ACP (Art Collaboration Platform)
&nbsp;
##### Iteration 1 Plan:
Start Date: Jan. 31, 2017
End Date: Feb. 08, 2017

##### Roles and Responsibilities:
* Kaiyang Wen: Front End, Database, Unit Tests
* YanBo Ding: Database(Query), Back-End
* ZeLin Li: Database(Query), Back-End
* YuAng Zhang: Front-End, Back-End, Unit Tests
* Hao Tian Wang: Database(Query), Back-End
* Chuying Ou: Back-End

##### Planned Events and Meetings:
1. Mandatory meetings every week during scheduled in class tutorials for a progress and planning report. These meetings will be occasions where the majority of the group can come together and discuss project/product direction and development. Also used to plan iterations and set goals as well as resolve major issues.
2. Optional daily online voice call check-ins for concerns and collaboration between group members. These check-ins serve as to aid team members in communicating more fluently and frequently, as well as addressing minor issues when they arise as soon as possible.

##### Project Management Artifacts:
1. A list of goals set for the iteration. This list will be drawn up in the earliest weekly meeting and amended to the iteration plan at the start of every iteration.
2. GitHub repository allows for our group to keep an easily accessible backlog of work as well as track where the work is coming from.
3. Online Google Doc will serve as our book-keeping tool to keep track of topics discussed during meetings and decisions made. This will be updated consistently to keep missing attendees up to date on current progress. 
4. The GitHub issues feature will allow our team members to take responsibility for tasks as well as showing the current distribution of workload to other members of the team. We will add the issue labels in a scale of pri[1] to pri[10] to prioritize tasks, where the lower the number the higher the priority. Issues discovered can then be added to the GitHub repository where the work can be distributed.

##### Product Goals and Tasks for Iteration 1:
   * Discuss and identify key components to the implementation of the product:
   * Partition the product idea into different components (back-end, database, front-end).
   * Create a broad to-do list of features that need to be worked on in a priority sequence.
   * Assign roles and responsibilities for each group member based on their respective strengths and comfort with the corresponding to-do list.
   * Each member of the group should discuss what they feel are the strengths, weaknesses, and experiences to construct an understanding of the teamâ€™s overall knowledge pool.
   * Test out our methods of communication for effectiveness.
   * Carry out the meetings and keep a record of attendance and work done for the meeting.
   * Test voice communication methods and find a suitable choice for future communication.
   * Record meeting history and key points in a Google Doc.

##### Artifacts for Goals and Tasks:
1. Google Doc of meeting history and meeting log. Maintains a good record of the effectiveness of our planned meeting schedule.
2. To-do list of goals set for product development after discussing and identifying features and requirements. Should be broad and provide a direction for product development in future iterations.
3. A GitHub repository for the product should be created in preparation of initial coding and development.
