# Iteration 1 Review

&nbsp;
### Product Name: ACP (Art Collaboration Platform)

&nbsp;
### Iteration 1 Review and Retrospect:

When: Feb 08 2017
Where: Online

### Project Process Reflection:
&nbsp;

__Effective decisions:__

1. Weekly Progress Report in tutorial with mandatory attendance
    * Mandatory progress reports with the entire group allowed for an overview of all aspects of project progress and development. Using a time where all but one of our members are available allows us to maintain good progress throughout planning and development.

2. Progress reports with information backlog for missing attendees and book-keeping purposes
    * Scheduling conflicts exist within our group, so members who were not able to make mandatory meetings were still able to catch up and view work done during the meetings.

3. Used Google Docs as a white board for our online meeting, and used voice chat (on WeChat) as the main communication tool
    * The collaborative nature of Google Doc worked well as a real-time whiteboard for showing ideas and opinions. By also utilizing a real-time voice chat, we were able to effectively communicate during our informal daily meetings.

4. Daily Voice Chat Check-in with optional attendance
    * The informal nature of these chats catered to the differences in comfort between members of the team. After being rescheduled to more convenient times late at night, these meetings proved to be effective means of quick communication during the iteration.

### Not as effective decisions:

1. Scheduling decisions regarding meetings
    * Outside of the mandatory weekly meeting (where we still can’t get every member of the group due to scheduling conflicts), we tried to have our online check-in in the morning. However, we soon realized that the morning is usually the busiest time for some people in the team. As a result, our planned check-in did not happen in most cases until we rescheduled it later as a result of this.

    * For the most part, our process planning went smoothly and seemed to work well for the members of our team. As a result, we did not really have many major decisions that completely defied our expectations as we made most decisions as a group.

### Planned changes (or already made):

1. We have changed the times of our informal daily check-in to night times around 9-10pm. This is to cater to the specific scheduling needs and preferences of our team members after we previously attempted a morning time. 

2. We are changing our method of voice communication from Skype to WeChat. WeChat is a more consistent mobile communication and messaging service that also provides group voice chat feature. Due to its mobile accessibility, we are more easily able to reach out to and receive prompt feedback from team members. Skype, in contrast, was much more inconsistent on the mobile platform and thus a hassle to use for members of the team.

### Product and Process Progress and Review:

__Completed goals and tasks:__

1. Discussing and identifying a broad To-Do list of tasks and objectives in our product design. This will be our overall product direction and provide us objectives for future iterations.
    * (Excerpts from meeting logs) To-Do List:
        1. Create database schemas.
        2. Create REST APIs and decide individual views
        3. Create a back-end function interface for login functionalities./ Create back-end functions that allow partial APIs work properly
        4. Design a way for backend server to store user's’ images. (The database keeps track of the identifiers, while the file system on the server side stores the actual images.)
        5. Create a simple front-end view.

2. Assign roles and responsibilities based on team member skills and specializations. Work out reasonable expectations of generic skills that should be learned to aid in the development of the product.
    * (Excerpts from meeting logs) Roles and Responsibilities:
        * Kaiyang Wen: Front End, Database, Unit Tests
        * YanBo Ding: Database(Query), Back-End
        * ZeLin Li: Database(Query), Back-End
        * YuAng Zhang: Front-End, Back-End, Unit Tests
        * Hao Tian Wang: Database(Query), Back-End
        * Chuying Ou: Back-End

    **Note:** since many group members are new to JavaScript, we may need some time to learn the language / standard libraries.

3. Testing out effective methods of communications (specifically voice chats). Refer to Planned changes (or already made) section.

4. Create a GitHub repository and update with planning information. (GitHub Team Repository was created for us.): https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-06

__Not completed goals and tasks:__

1. (Half) Maintaining a consistent backlog of meeting history and information. Due to some issues with documents and scheduling, we were unable to completely document all of our meetings in full detail. We have the meeting results and discussions for most of our meetings but have gaps in the history and consistency of the meeting logs. Going forward, we are aiming to create a more consistent template for meeting logs which we can proceed to fill in.
    * Some Meeting Logs:
        * 2017/01/30 (Includes schema brainstorming): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUcHKfbNXV5xJetT52Rv1jYV71KksF1Az8oWlFfT5BQ/edit

        * 2017/02/07: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vb52XDKfkQXo8Deyn0iv1b-H5UH2KJVc1YKaxAD5iA8/edit

__Meeting Highlights:__

1. We have discovered what makes communication effective. Our current meeting history needs to be worked on in order for it to more effectively serve its purpose as a planning and review tool. 

2. Our main goal for this iteration was to determine the project planning and direction. With the construction of our To-Do list, we have a broad segmentation of our product which we can now utilize as a directional guide for actual coding and development. Our goals for the next iteration will focus on beginning development on our To-Do list and refine the list where necessary.
