# Iteration 2 plan
&nbsp;
##### **Product Name:** ACP (Art Collaboration Platform)
&nbsp;
##### Iteration 2 Plan:
Start Date: Feb 15 2017
&nbsp;

End Date: March 10 2017

##### Roles and Responsibilities:
* Kaiyang Wen: Front End, Database, Unit Tests
* YanBo Ding: Database(Query), Back-End
* ZeLin Li: Pull-Request Manager, Database(Query), Back-End
* YuAng Zhang: Front-End, Back-End, Unit Tests
* Hao Tian Wang: Pull-Request Manager, Database(Query), Front-End
* Chuying Ou: Back-End

##### Planned Events and Meetings:
1. Mandatory meetings every week during scheduled in-class tutorials for a progress and planning report. These meetings will be occasions where the majority of the group can come together and discuss about project/product direction and development. Also used to plan iterations and set goals as well as resolve major issues.
2. Optional daily online voice call check-ins for concerns and collaboration between group members. These check-ins serve as to aid team members in communicating more fluently and frequently, as well as addressing minor issues when they arise as soon as possible.

##### Project Management Artifacts:
1. A list of goals set for the iteration. This list will be drawn up in the earliest weekly meeting and amended to the iteration plan at the start of every iteration. 
2. GitHub repository allows for our group to keep an easily accessible backlog of work as well as track where the work is coming from. 
3. Online Google Doc will serve as our book-keeping tool to keep track of topics discussed during meetings and decisions made. This will be updated consistently to keep missing attendees up to date on current progress. 
4. For our project management, we will adopt the Kanban software process model through the use of GitHub issues. The issues feature will allow our team members to take responsibility for tasks as well as showing the current distribution of workload to other members of the team. We will prioritize tasks in a scale of pri[1] to pri10, where the lower the number the higher the priority. Issues discovered can then be added to the GitHub repository where the work can be distributed.

##### Git / GitHub workflow:
* For our project development in this iteration, we have decided to do branching development on different modules for the final product. To this extent, we have decided to make branches for specific portions of the project such as back-end, front-end, documentation, database, etc. Due to the need to commit these branches to master when completed, we have also assigned pull request management responsibilities to members of the group. It is the jobs of these members to ensure that whatever is pulled to the master branch is deployable and non-conflicting.

##### Product Goals and Tasks for Iteration 2:
* Back End:
 * Setup database server on back-end
 * Create database schemas
 * Brainstorm database relations
 * Discuss and optimize relations and tables
 * Construct schema.sql
 * Test schema.sql with SQL queries
 * Create REST APIs and decide individual views
 * Create a back-end function interface for login functionalities./ Create back-end functions that allow partial APIs work properly
 * Design a way for backend server to store user's images. (The database keeps track of the identifiers, while the file system on the server side stores the actual images.) 

* Front-End:
 * Identify required pages
 * Design and draft page layouts and templates
 * Choose and setup front-end framework and test server.
 * Create a simple front-end view for the demo.
 
##### Misc:
1. Create a short demo video
2. Update documentation as needed throughout iteration

##### Artifacts for Goals and Tasks:
1. Google Doc of meeting history and meeting log. Maintains a good record of the effectiveness of our planned meeting schedule.
2. Database schema brainstorm and DDL file
3. REST APIs
4. Brainstorms and sketches
5. Screenshots of Front-End development and UI
