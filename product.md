# Art Collaboration Platform (ACP)

#### Project Idea:

We are going to build a website serves as a project platform for anyone who likes community-created artworks. 

Adopting the ideas from existing concurrent doodling websites such as [Colorillo](http://colorillo.com/), art gallery websites such as [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/) and version control websites such as [Github](https://github.com/), the product we are going to build will be a mixture of them.

The basis of this website relies on the artists. This website supports three major functions, one of them is to encourage the artists regularly upload finished AND unfinished artworks (as project source files in some agreed format such as ".psd") onto the website and display them to other site visitors.

One of the other supported functions is to display existing artworks in this community for site explorers. Besides the usual art display feature on other common web-gallery domains, since the artists are encouraged to upload works regularly, the art display feature can also visualize the history of an artwork using some sort of directed graph or/and red-line drawing.

Of course, the last major function is to make source artwork at download-able by other artists with permission. The objective of this feature is to make the domain a remote version control system, so collaboration between artists on this website is then well supported.

The owner(s) of the artwork will be everybody who contributed to the artwork. A graph of contributions of contributors will be available all the time within one project.

#### Project Users and Target Audience

Our users ranged from professional artists, fashion designers, artists students, hobbyists and even kids who enjoy making arts and sharing with others in a collaborative manner.

With the visualization and version control features, site viewers can see how is an artwork achieved from the egg, and how do ideas transform between artists even when they are working on the same prototype. This kind of Information sharing may promote the confidence of collaboration and is thus benefiting target users.


#### User Needs and Expectations

At this time there are very few tools to visualize how is a piece of artwork built step by step. With this new tool, such visualization may be very possible.

Also, with this new tool, individuals are able to learn from each other and comment on each othersâ€™ work. This software can also be used for educational purpose.

Lots of people enjoy the beauty of art. This software is a platform for those artists who can share and draw anything they want. Moreover, there would be hopefully lots of resources created by others, people can gain some wonderful ideas from them.

 Hopefully, people will gain a sense of accomplishment of to be involved/contributed in a large piece of artwork.

### Highlights

We originally had 6 ideas, one of them was making a volume-adjusting tool, one was making an online game platform chat room. We decided to make this product because it can potentially create a great community.
